# Local first, multi-local next

Researching enablers for the next generation data creation, storage and exchange. Position data at the core - an encapsulated, immutable, versioned, auditable and transferable aggregate. Restore data safety, privacy and ownership in the hands of its creators. Increase robustness by minimizing data transfer, minimize reliance on remote services, their up-time, connectivity and access. Simplify security, eliminate trust on service providers and reduce the functional dependence on cloud services. Commodify centralized services as exchangeable, disposable utilities.
